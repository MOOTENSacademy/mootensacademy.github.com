So many tags, categories, classes, tutorials, explanations, rabbitholes, frustrations, errors, mistakes, triumphs, gold, shit have I gone through.

My perspective is very valuable due to the amount of Time, Energy, and Space that I put into learning, understanding, organizing, and creating the knowledge and expertise I know today.

I do not like the inefficiency of the state of programming how it is now.

I have seen where there is a great deal of NEED in the community.

Branding, tokenization, blockchain, internet, databases, smarthphones, structure, powerstations, electricity, technology, innovation.

We truly are standing on the shoulders of giants.

The goal is to use technology to the most of our advantage and accomplish everything we want to accomplish in the most efficient way possible.

How to do this?

Use my perspective. I am putting my TIME ENERGY AND SPACE in order to most effectively COMMUNICATE my ideas and make to most positive impact. I want you to copy the code. I want you to use what works. I want you to use the minimal amount of effort in order to accomplish everything you want to accomplish.
