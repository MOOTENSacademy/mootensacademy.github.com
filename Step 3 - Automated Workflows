I take a deep breath after opening up voice recorder. I write the number of days alive I am as the title of the new voice recording.

I start talking about the beautiful day, time, location, what I was doing, How I feel / think / act about that, and continue with my train of consioussness.

I hold the check in verbalization to 10 minute increment / chunks.

Make it a habit to finish at 10 minutes,

But can continue the "rant" if after 10 minute chunk, Verbalization is not completed.

This morning podcast is more efficient if consistent and with structure.

This content is good structure to use as a base for redirection of other content.

Also beneficial for the individual doing the recording to verbalize and hold accountable.
