### What about these?



- *Facebook*
- *Telegram*
- discord
- *skype*
- *linkedin*
- *vimeo*
- myspace
- snapchat
- tik tok
- vine
- etc

*Bolded interesting for the future, but not a priority right now*

- Facebook for marketing, and ads. I do not support it, and there is no need at this moment.
- Telegram for communities that are build / encryption crucial
- Skype for interviews, networking, communication
- Linkedin: seems like another reddit, to repost stuff? Who goes on Linkedin?
- Vimeo: Video Backup other than Youtube. What would the flow be? Upload to Vimeo right after uploading to youtube, but before Steemit?
